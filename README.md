Scikit-learn is a machine learning library for Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling. It includes various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, as well as tools for model selection and evaluation. Scikit-learn is widely used for building and deploying machine learning applications.

## installation process

  1. install using  python pip

     ```
     pip install scikit-learn
     ```
     This command will download and install the latest version of scikit-learn from the Python Package Index (PyPI), but this will require the addition packages, to install, like notebook, numpy, pandas etc...,
     when we download the anaconda package or miniconda environment, it will preinstall the additional requirements, by using `pyPI` will require, microsoft redistributable 2019, cmake and addition .net frameworks, so we need to install          manually and then install the package, this process requrie more space
